# Executive Summary

###Why?
  The design of a system to help streamline the process of implementing open source software is incredibly important. The use of
open source software has increased as a whole and companies need a system in place to help ensure they are using software that aligns with 
the goals and direction of the company. Checking software packages for licenses and vulnerabilities is a major step in the implementation
process of open source software. With proper license and vulnerability information, managers are better able to create and edit company policy.

###Using the system
  Implementation of this system would make the lives of both the developer and the manager easier. Streamlining complex processes into one or two steps
is one way developers and managers benefit. Submitting a software package to one process and retrieving license/vulnerability results is less time consuming
and overall easier for developers. Future projects completed by a company who utilizes a system like this would have shortened expected completion times
Developers would spend less time trying to figure out if they can use certain software packages and more time actually developing. Overall, this system increases productivity, reduces headaches and 
helps managers ensure company policy is up to date.
